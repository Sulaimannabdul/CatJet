# CatJet ❤️
CatJet (similar to flappy bird) game, it involves several steps, including setting up the game environment, handling player input, managing game physics, and rendering graphics. I'am use the Pygame library for this project, as it provides functionalities that are perfect for 2D game development.

### ***CatJet is now on 2.0 version***
